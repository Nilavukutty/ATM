Securing ATM Transactions with Facial Recognition-Based Verification Systems
🔐 Project Overview
This project aims to enhance the security of ATM transactions using a facial recognition-based user verification system. By replacing or complementing traditional authentication methods like PINs and cards, facial recognition reduces the risk of fraud and unauthorized access.

🎯 Objectives
Prevent ATM fraud through biometric verification.

Enable secure, real-time user authentication.

Improve user experience by reducing reliance on physical tokens (cards, PINs).

🚀 Features
Real-time facial recognition using OpenCV and machine learning.

User registration and facial data encoding.

ATM-style interface for withdrawal and verification.

Alerts on unauthorized access attempts.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: Python (Tkinter or PyQt for UI)

Backend: Python (Flask for APIs if needed)

Libraries: OpenCV, dlib, face_recognition, NumPy

Database: SQLite or any preferred DB for storing user profiles

🧑‍💻 How It Works
User Registration: Capture user's facial data and store encoded face vectors in a secure database.

Transaction Attempt: When a user initiates a transaction, a live image is captured.

Verification: The system compares the live image with stored data.

Access Control: Grant or deny access based on face match confidence level.

🔧 Installation
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/atm-facial-recognition.git

📸 Sample Workflow
Register your face.

Attempt ATM access.

Facial recognition verifies identity.

Proceed with transaction securely.

✅ Future Enhancements
Integration with banking APIs.

Liveness detection to prevent spoofing.

Support for multi-factor authentication (MFA).
